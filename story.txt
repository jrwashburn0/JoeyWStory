Allow me to introduce you to Johnny. Johnny is my neighbor and every night, I
hear strange noises coming from Johnny's room. No one else is in there with him,
so I always wonder what's going on. 

Johnny has an older brother who works down the street at McDonalds, but
doesnt live with him for certain reasons. Johnny has bright pale skin with
brown eyes and pink hair. I really don't know why his hair is pink but it is.
